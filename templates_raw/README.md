# template builder for  UI
This is just the template builder - not needed to run __nichtparasoup__.


## idea
To have proper IDE support when it comes to writing the UI, the thing should be written in several raw files and be
yuiCompressed and put together at the end.
Furthermore it would be great to be able to develop the UI without running __nichtparasoup__.


## requirements
* python2+
* sudo pip install html5lib beautifulsoup4
* java (optional, but highly suggested for JS and CSS compression)


## how to use
just run the `build.sh` so the `templates.py` of __nichtparasoup__ will be built automatically
