/* hot keys coming soon.

idea:
* right := make interval slower
* left := make interval faster
* space := toggle play/pause
* escape := toggle boss mode -> stop all loading, make all content invisible and show some productive instead ;-)

if a hot key is pressed, show a badge or something for notification ....
maybe its enough to just toggle the <header> or something?

hot keys need to be marked in the <footer> or somewhere noticeable ...
